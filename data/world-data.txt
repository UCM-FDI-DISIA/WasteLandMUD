Room BC-LandingPad
Name Base Camp: Landing Pad
Description 
Ships fly in low before disgorging their 
small contingent of equipment, supplies, and more rarely, 
people. The landing pads are surrounded with constantly 
swirling dust, driving most new arrivals northward into the 
shelter of the walled camp amidst the featureless wastes.

Room BC-CampSquare
Name Base Camp: Camp Square
Description 
The camp bustles with motion. Here 
inside the walls the storm of wind and dust outside is 
subdued, but not entirely abated. If one wanted to get out 
of the blowing grit, they'd likely need to head inside the 
sturdy pre-fabricated buildings that fill the camp. Few 
people cross the square unless traveling between the Landing 
Pads to the south, the barracks to the west, the armory to 
the east, or the camp's gates to the north.

Room BC-CampGate
Name Base Camp: Camp Gate
Description 
Guards and emplaced guns keep the camp safe
from outside threats, but once you walk north into the wastes, 
you're on your own. the core of the mercenary camp lies deeper 
behind the walls, south.
